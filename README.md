# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This app is about saving your travels.
In this react+vite application, hooks were used. One of which are react-router-dom, custom hooks (mostly useState and useEffect).
For the global state handling, the useContext was used for a smaller app like this.
Third party library that was used for the map was "Leaflet"
For the styling was used CSS modules.
Also want to mention that this was a part Jonas Schmedtmann program, and the copyrights in his name.
